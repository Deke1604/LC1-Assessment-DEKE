REST, or Representational State Transfer, is a style of web service that uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to send and receive data. SOAP, or Simple Object Access Protocol, is a messaging format for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. And GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to specify exactly what data they need from a server.
REST is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. SOAP is known for its security, reliability, and standards compliance. And GraphQL is known for its performance, scalability, and developer-friendliness. One major difference between REST and SOAP is that REST uses HTTP methods, while SOAP uses a different protocol, called XML-RPC. Another major difference is that SOAP is more standards-based, while REST is more flexible and allows for more innovation.
GraphQL is a newer technology that combines some of the best features of both REST and SOAP. It's as simple and flexible as REST, but it also has the security and reliability of SOAP. One thing to keep in mind is that GraphQL is not as well-supported as REST or SOAP, so it may be harder to find resources and support for it. But many developers find it to be a superior technology.
