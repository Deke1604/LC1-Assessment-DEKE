We'll take the class diagram we've created and translate it into Python code. We'll start by creating a "User" class in Python. The "User" class will have attributes like "username" and "password", and it will have methods like "login" and "logout". The "User" class will also have a "get_accounts" method that returns a list of "Account" objects.
First, we'll create the "User" class in Python:

class User:
def init(self, username, password):
self.username = username
self.password = password

def login(self, username, password):
    if self.username == username and self.password == password:
        return True
    else:
Then, we'll create the "Account" class:

class Account:
def init(self, username, balance):
self.username = username
self.balance = balance

def get_balance(self)
    return self.balance
Next, we'll create the "Transaction" class:

class Transaction:
def init(self, user_id, transaction_amount):
self.user_id = user_id
self.transaction_amount = transaction_amount

def add_to_account(self, account_id):
    account = Account.get_by_id(account_id)
    account.balance += self.transaction_amount
    account.save()

def get_transaction_history(self, user_id):
    return self.user_id == user_id and user_id in account.transactions
Now we'll create the "Budget" class:

class Budget:
def init(self, name, starting_balance):
self.name = name
self.starting_balance = starting_balance

def get_balance(self):
    return self.starting_balance - self.transactions.sum()
Now we can put it all together and make the "Application" class:

class Application:
def init(self):
self.users = []
self.accounts = []
self.transactions = []
self.budgets = []

def add_user(self, username, password):
    user = User.create(username, password)
