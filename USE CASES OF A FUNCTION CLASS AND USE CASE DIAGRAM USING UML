A use case diagram is a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that shows the different ways that a system can be used. In this case, we're going to create a use case diagram for a function class. A function class is a collection of functions that are related to each other in some way.

To create the use case diagram, we'll need to start with a rectangle, which represents the function class. Then, we'll add ovals to the diagram, each representing a different use case. The ovals should be connected to the function class by lines. Finally, we'll label the ovals with the different use cases.
Here's an example of what the use case diagram might look like:

In this example, the function class is called "Addition". The different use cases are "Add two numbers", "Add three numbers", and "Add four numbers".

Now that we've created the use case diagram, we can use it to analyze the different ways that the function class can be used. This can help us to identify any potential problems or improvements that can be made to the function class.
